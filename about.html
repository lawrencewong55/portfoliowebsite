                <p class="pborder">Greetings. My name is Lawrence Wong. Originally
                    a chef, I decided to go with a career change and take the leap into the world of web development.
                    My passion for creative design and my nerdy interest in coding has brought me to General Assembly, to a course
                    that married my two interests together. And thus... I finished my training in Front End Web Development.

         <h2>General Assembly - Front End Web Development</h2>
         <p> When I was going through my career change, I had enrolled into a 6-week course in Front-end Web Development at 
             General Assembly in London. From there, I had learned the basics of HTML as well as CSS and Javascript, 
             to make the pages more interactive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> My time at General Assembly was fun and it is all thanks to my tutors that were informative and helpful. 
                My 6 weeks was also challenging too as each week, we were provided with lessons and then homework to test out knowledge on. 
                The challenges were a little difficult towards the end of the term, but that was because we were introduced to Javascript. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Front end web development course, and now I am equipped with some new skillsets 
                to work on my own projects and tackle on new challenges too!

           <h2>All things geeky!</h2>

            <p> Everyone loves videogames, letâ€™s face it. But when it comes to me, 
                I am such a connoisseur of videogames that I tend to shamelessly buy limited editions of my favourite titles! 
                Heck, I even run a twitch channel as a hobby to livestream myself playing videogames
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> My first taste of basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript came from trying to modify an interactive checklist for my viewers to see my objectives! 
                Thanks to the GA FEWD course, I am now equipped with the skills to improve on the code for the aesthetics of my channel!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Aside from all of this, I also have a huge interest in Japanese manga and anime, 
                as well as all things comics, in case it wasn't obvious!

           <h2>Musical Jam</h2>

           <p> One of my favourite hobbies is playing on the piano. I had picked it up when my uncle had brought an electric keyboard.
                I think it was then, when I had taken a serious interest into playing music. Growing up, I wasn't able to afford lessons.
                But that didn't stop me. I simply forced myself to learn by ear. By not giving up and staying determined, I have managed
                to increase my proficiency in my piano playing!

       <div class="chef">
       <h2>'Chef'ness</h2>
       <p>I was brought up with home cooking from my grandparents and my parent's own takeaway so naturally, I encouraged myself to
            learn to cook too. In fact, I have been working for my parents, creating signature Peking dishes and learning to perfect the 
            craft of cooking.
